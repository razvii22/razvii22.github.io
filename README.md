### Welcome to razvii's main page!



#### This is just meant as a basic landing page with most if not all of my socials, projects and information that I am willing to give out.


## Short Description
I am a recent graduate from a technical highschool with a deep passion and interest in finding out how the littlest things work.
Recently I have taken interest in 3d printing and general CNC mechanisms, and now own a 3d printer and working towards assembling my own CNC router.
I have taken a year off of school due to personal reasons so I have started learning programming in Lua and the [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) framework!
 
Though, all this being said, a great passion of mine is taking in broken,disheveled or in general old and thought to be useless hardware such as laptops,computers and printers, and repurposing them into new or at the very least useful projects, when I start posting about that, you will be able to find info and maybe videos of it on:
### [Epsicronics](https://razvii22.github.io/Epsicronics)
(WIP!)
 
Recently I have also taken interest in Linux, having used it a lot in VMS, and am now running [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) and enjoying actually having freedom with my computer!


## [Fiverr Store](https://www.fiverr.com/therazbee)
 I have opened a fiverr page where right now I am just offering 3D CAD designs created in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)(My software of choice!) for a little profit and mostly for experience in industrial design,3D printing and CNC manufacturing in general, maybe drop by and buy something for 5 dollars?  
 I may be planning on selling other similar services in the near future, but that remains to be seen!
 
For a full list of all of my current models that I keep up to date you can visit [this repository!](https://github.com/razvii22/FreeCAD)
