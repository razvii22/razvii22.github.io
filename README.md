### Welcome to razvii's main page!



#### This is just meant as a basic landing page with most if not all of my socials, projects and information that I am willing to give out.


## Short Description
I am a recent graduate from a technical highschool with a deep passion and interest in finding out how the littlest things work.
Recently I have taken interest in 3d printing and general CNC mechanisms, and now own a 3d printer and working towards assembling my own CNC router.
I have taken a year off of school due to personal reasons so I have started learning programming in Lua and the Love2d framework!



## [Fiverr Store](https://www.fiverr.com/therazbee)
 I have opened a fiverr page where right now I am just offering 3D CAD designs created in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)(My software of choice!) for a little profit and mostly for experience in industrial design,3D printing and CNC manufacturing in general, maybe drop by and buy something for 5 dollars?
 I may be planning on selling other similar services in the near future, but that remains to be seen
